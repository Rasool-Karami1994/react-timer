# Reflection

-Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to use and control a stop watch with fully functionality like start, stop, resume and reset buttons.

I used React and Css for building this project and I practice useEffect and useState hooks.
