# NOTE-APP Project

An application used to add, edit and delete notes, built with vanila JavaScript, and CSS.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `install node modules`

first of all in Terminal you should install node modules package.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Reflection

-Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to use and control a stop watch with fully functionality like start, stop, resume and reset buttons.

I used React and Css for building this project and I practice useEffect and useState hooks.
